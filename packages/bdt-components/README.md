This previously all existed in and for Gatsby. I recently migrated to Astro, and in the grand scheme of shifting, it has quickly becoming apparent that coupling the look of the website to the delivery mechanism/framework dejour is a little bit self-defeating.

Although, in all honesty, I just find all this plumbing business a little bit fun.
