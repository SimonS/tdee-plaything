# BDT Components

This all existed in and for Gatsby. I then migrated to Astro, and in the grand scheme of shifting, it has become apparent that coupling the look of the website to the delivery mechanism/framework dejour is a little bit self-defeating.

Although, in all honesty, I find all this plumbing business a little bit fun.
