# BDT Components

In the grand scheme of shifting to/playing with Astro, it's quickly becoming apparent that coupling the look of the website to the delivery mechanism/framework dejour is a little bit self-defeating.

So I've pivoted my standalone storybook config into more of a component library. That way, until I've shifted everything across, I can theoretically serve both gatsby and astro from the same place without too much copy/paste.

Although, in all honesty, I just find all this plumbing business a little bit fun.
