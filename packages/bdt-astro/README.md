# astro.bdt

Shifting what's currently generated at https://gatsby.breakfastdinnertea.co.uk will likely live at https://astro.breakfastdinnertea.co.uk initially - with relative parity with what's there now.

I think medium/long-term I need to figure out what this thing is for.

## Mini-todo list

- [x] little bit of root styling
- [x] move layout across
- [x] create framework agnostic component library (with tests?)
- [x] hookup storybook to new library
- [x] nav
- [x] footer
- [x] logo
- [x] bins
  - [x] bin component
  - [x] bin data
- [ ] films
  - [x] film component
  - [x] film template
  - [ ] film data
  - [ ] film pagination
  - [ ] pagination component
- [ ] deploy to astro.breakfastdinnertea.co.uk
