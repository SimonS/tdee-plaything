# astro.bdt

Temporarily, I'm hosting duplicate sites at gatsby.breakfastdinnertea.co.uk and astro.breakfastdinnertea.co.uk just to do some basic comparison. Once I've confirmed that I've got equal(ish) functionality at a fraction of the page load, I'll completely decommission the Gatsby one.

I find the mental model of something simpler like astro easier to understand (it could have just as easily been eleventy, but the allure of the new and all that) - especially when I've put it down for a while. Gatsby leaves me constantly feeling like I'm migrating to the next version without ever having a moment to build new stuff, and then the integrations with third parties (the internal graphql api etc) are hard to grok after the fact. It's a bit like regexes - easy enough to read, but leave it a month and it's all a foreign language to me at first glance.
